# FMI-First-Homework

In this repository is uploaded my first homework from university. It consisted of 10 tasks. A link to the tasks' requirements is added below.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ATu-xPAL7cFYPAey7N03qQKNi3jGkTX0_GnvLkMC-fE/

The naming convention of the files is as follows fnXXXXX_probY_CC. 

XXXXX - my faculty number(61988)<br />
Y - number of task(from 1 to 10)<br />
CC - used compiler(always gcc)

For an example the first task is: **fn61988_prob1_gcc.cpp**
